I'm not sure how to help with "car image" in a code context. Could you clarify what you need?

For example, are you looking to:
- Display an image in HTML?
- Load an image in Python?
- Create SVG car graphics?
- Work with an image library?

Please provide more details about what you're trying to build.
## Common Image Formats

- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg) - Compressed, good for photos
- **PNG** (.png) - Lossless, supports transparency
- **WebP** (.webp) - Modern, smaller file sizes
- **SVG** (.svg) - Vector format, scalable
- **GIF** (.gif) - Animated or static images
- **BMP** (.bmp) - Uncompressed, larger files

Which format works best depends on your use case and where you're displaying the image.
